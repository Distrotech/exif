{"name":"Exif","tagline":"","body":"\t\t\t\t      EXIF\r\n\t\t\t\t      ----\r\n\r\n'exif' is a small command-line utility to show EXIF information hidden\r\nin JPEG files. I wrote it to demonstrate the power of libexif.\r\n\r\nIt depends on \r\n * libexif (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libexif)\r\n * popt\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\nLutz <lutz@users.sourceforge.net>\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDING\r\n--------\r\n\r\nAssuming libexif and popt are installed, building exif from the source\r\ntar ball should be a simple matter of:\r\n\r\n  ./configure\r\n  make\r\n  sudo make install\r\n\r\nIf your libexif is installed in a non-standard location, you must point\r\nconfigure at the location of its libexif.pc file using the pkg-config\r\npath, like this:\r\n\r\n  ./configure PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig\r\n\r\nWhen building from CVS, run this before configuring:\r\n\r\n  autoreconf -i\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONALIZATION\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nAll translations for exif (except en_CA) are coordinated by the\r\nTranslation Project at http://translationproject.org/.  This means\r\nthat ALL changes to the .po files (except that exception) MUST be\r\nmade through the TP web site, or they will be eventually overwritten\r\nand lost.  If you are interested in translating exif into a new\r\nlanguage, simply join TP and start!  A translation disclaimer is NOT\r\nrequired for exif; by making a translation, you agree implicitly to\r\nprovide it under the same license terms as the rest of exif (GPL).\r\nWhen a new version of exif is available for translation, an exif\r\nmaintainer will contact the Translation Project and all interested TP\r\nmembers will be automatically notified.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
